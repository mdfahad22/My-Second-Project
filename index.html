                <h1>Crash Landing On You</h1>
                <p>
                  Crash Landing on You has a little bit of everything—forbidden
                  romance, family drama, political strife, car chases, and
                  comedy. The show boasts a large cast of characters, but stars
                  Yon Se-jin as Yoon Seri, a South Korean Heiress and
                  businesswoman, and Hyun Bin as Ri Jeong-hyoek, a Captain of
                  the North Korean Special Police. Seri quite literally crash
                  lands into Jeong-hyoek’s life, and the drama deals with the
                  many, many complications that arise from a South Korean being
                  hidden in North Korea. Surprisingly, my favorite parts of the
                  K-drama were actually spent in North Korea. Unfortunately, I
                  found it was a little too hard to suspend my disbelief in the
                  parts that took place in South Korea and Switzerland. Despite
                  this, the acting was solid and sells the emotional story,
                  which highlights the disparities between these two countries.
